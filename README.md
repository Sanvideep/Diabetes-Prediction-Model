# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This project presents a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a patient based on key medical parameters. The dataset used is a well-known diabetes dataset, containing several diagnostic features and one target variable, Outcome, which indicates whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).
